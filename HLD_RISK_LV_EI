### Class Diagram for Risk Management – Entity Information
This diagram includes common entities/tables that are synchronized from external systems.  
Data synchronization is developed mainly to support the **Onsite Visit Module** and is re-used in the **Risk Management Module**.  

**Diagram Summary (textual description):**
- Central entity: **Entity**
- Relationships:
  - Entity ↔ Entity Type (1..1)
  - Entity ↔ Entity Size (1..1)
  - Entity ↔ Classification (1..1)
  - Entity ↔ Category (1..1)
  - Entity ↔ Region (0..*) → Region ↔ City (1..0..*)
  - Entity ↔ City (0..*)
- Each Entity can belong to one **Type**, one **Size**, one **Classification**, one **Category**.
- Entities are associated with **Region** and **City** for location context.

**Notes:**
- Role permission tables are shared with other modules, not described here.
- Entities/tables in light green are mainly described in other diagrams.
