# Risk Management – Integration

## Overview
Risk Management integrates with multiple NCNP modules and external systems to exchange evaluation forms, disclosure questionnaires, evaluation execution results, and corrective actions. Integration is asynchronous using **Business Event Hub** with subscriptions, combined with synchronous **REST APIs** for triggering actions.

## Integration Points

### 1. Evaluation Form Management
- Flow:
  - Actor approves form → REST API → Publish event `EvaluationFormApproved`.
  - Risk Management subscribes and retrieves the form.
- Purpose: Provide forms for configuring risk calculations.

---

### 2. Disclosure Management
- Flow:
  - Actor creates/updates disclosure questionnaire → REST API → Publish event `DisclosureQuestionnaireCreated/Updated`.
  - Risk Management subscribes and retrieves disclosure questionnaires.
- Purpose: Link disclosure questionnaires as inputs into Risk configuration.

---

### 3. Evaluation Execution
- Flow:
  - Actor submits evaluation → REST API → Publish event `AnswerCreated`.
  - Risk Management subscribes and retrieves evaluation results.
  - Notifications triggered for status updates.
- Purpose: Sync final evaluation scores to Risk Management.

---

### 4. Corrective Action Module
- **Observation Sync**:
  - Observation created in Risk Management → Publish event `ObservationCreated`.
  - Corrective Action module subscribes and retrieves observation for tracking.
- **Corrective Action Sync**:
  - Corrective Action created in Risk Management → Publish event `CorrectiveActionCreated`.
  - Corrective Action module subscribes and retrieves for follow-up.
- Notifications are also triggered at each event.

---

## Architectural Notes
- Business Event Hub is the central async broker for module-to-module integration.
- REST APIs are used for synchronous actions (e.g., create/update).
- Risk Management depends on Evaluation Form, Disclosure, and Execution modules as **inbound integrations**.
- Corrective Actions are **outbound integrations** from Risk Management.
