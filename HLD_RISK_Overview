## 4.x System Overview — Risk Management

### Sub-Modules
- **Risk Configuration**  
  Defines Manual/Defined Risks, Risk Types, Criteria Weights, Risk Presentation.  
  Integrates with external data (Evaluation Forms/Results).  
  Triggers recalculation of Risk Component and Final Scores → inputs for dashboards & reports.

- **Inspection Plan and Journey**  
  Creates and manages inspection plans & journeys.  
  During journeys, users create Observations, Inquiries, and Corrective Actions → forwarded to Corrective Action module.  
  Final Report aggregates risk scores, observations, corrective actions.

- **ERDC (Entity Risk Data & Calculation)**  
  Stores calculation results for Risk Scores.  
  Provides dashboards and visualizations.  
  Maintains snapshots (current vs monthly).

- **Risk Integration**  
  Handles communication with external modules (Form Management, Form Execution, Corrective Action).  
  Uses **Kafka (async events)** for cross-module integration, consistent with system-wide microservices.

### External Dependencies
- **External Data Sources**: Evaluation Form Management, Form Execution.  
- **Corrective Action Module**: Receives corrective actions and warnings.
